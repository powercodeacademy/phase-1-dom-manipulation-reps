# Overview

These exercises are to practice DOM manipulation. Core concepts to practice are using query selectors, updating elements on the page, and iterating.

To get started, fork and clone this repository. Then, open up the `index.html` page in a web browser, and code your solutions in the `index.js` file. There is no test suite here!
